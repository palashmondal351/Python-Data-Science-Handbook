# Python-Data-Science-Handbook
Data science all revised code from "Python Data Science Handbook" by Jack VanderPlas.

In this reprository I broadly explored all the code which is covered in "Python Data Science Handbook" book by Jack VanderPlas. This book is available in O'Reilly Publication with price US 59.99$ of revised history 2016-11-17. This book I found very useful for Data scientist and AI/ML engineer. 

*** I fixed most of the library issue which are not supported / depricated in the latest version. 
Used library version:
# numpy: 1.16.5
# pandas: 0.24.2
# matplotlib: 3.1.1
# nltl: 3.4.5
# sklearn: 0.21.3

# Chapter and description: 

### IPython: Beyond Normal Python: 
Explain in details all about basic python functionallity and it's uses. 

### Introduction to NumPy:
This all about numpy and it's basic to advance all functionality and its uses. 

### Data Manipulation with Pandas:
Here broadly discussed the pandas dataframe and it's used and mostly cover all type of pandas dataframe computations. 

### Visualization with Matplotlib:
Matplotlib visualization, This is very amazing when you will work on data and visualize it on your own way. 

### Machine Learning: 
*** This chapter is topmost important to me I and I hope you will give the same importance to this chapter. This chapter mostly cover medium and high level, If you cover all the above chapter properly you will find great insight in this chapter with practical face detection pipeline real project.
